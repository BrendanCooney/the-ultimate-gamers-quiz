## Unfixed Bugs:
At time of Deployment the counting score function does not work correctly. This is a work in progress. 

## Deployment:
This project was Deployed to Github fromo the source section. It was the master branch.

## Credits:
I would like to thank the Code Institute for the opportunity once again. In my previous project I focussed mainly on Love Running as and example. This time I decided to focus on a tutorial that was not part of the course in order to give me more exposure to JavaScript. 

I followed this tutorial and all credit goes to this developer Kyle Cook and the Code Institute.

## Content:

The Logo was created with Canva. The Favicon was also created with Canva.

The questions are questions that I came up with. My sons are avid gamers and the games mentioned are within their age bracket.

I kept the colours similar to the previous project. If possible I will aim to keep the same theme throughout the projects for cosistency.

The only image used in this project is the logo. There are however media queries created to make sure all flex boxes and the gaming area are totally responsive.
