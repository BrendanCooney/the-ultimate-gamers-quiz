## Unfixed Bugs:
All bugs were tested and retested manually. I attempted to add more questions but this stopped functionality so I did not add more.  

## Deployment:
This project was Deployed to Github fromo the source section. It was the master branch.

## Credits:
I would like to thank the Code Institute for the opportunity once again. In my previous project I focussed mainly on Love Running as and example. This time I decided to focus on a tutorial that was not part of the course in order to give me more exposure to JavaScript. 

I followed this tutorial and all credit goes to this developer Kyle Cook and the Code Institute.

Code Institute: Couning Timer 

Student Support Assisted me with solving the counter problem

## Content:

The Logo was created with Canva. The Favicon was also created with Canva.

The questions are questions that I came up with. My sons are avid gamers and the games mentioned are within their age bracket.

I kept the colours similar to the previous project. If possible I will aim to keep the same theme throughout the projects for cosistency.



## Media:
The Bannners are a new edition and incorporate the logo. There are however media queries created to make sure all flex boxes and the gaming area are totally responsive.
